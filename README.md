# Immersive VR Schizophrenic Experience

An immersive virtual reality experience meant to simulate a schizophrenic episode â€“ the trigger and the episode itself. Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder often stigmatized due some of its symptoms, such as: drastic personality changes, irregular motor behavior, and disorganized speech. This experience's goal is to facilitate the learning and understanding of people with schizophrenia using VR, where the user can immerse themselves in a situation where people living with schizophrenia are discriminated against.
